'''1. Write a program which can filter even numbers in a list by using filter function. The list is: 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
'''

# l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# k=filter(lambda x: x%2==0 ,l)
# print(list(k))


'''. Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after 
removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again 
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world
'''

#already done in another set


'''3 . Define a Python function "alternating(l)" that returns True if the values in the input list alternately go 
up and down (in a strict manner).
For instance:
>>> alternating([])
True
>>> alternating([1,3,2,3,1,5])
True
>>> alternating([3,2,3,1,5])
True
>>> alternating([3,2,2,1,5])
False
>>> alternating([3,2,1,3,5])
False
