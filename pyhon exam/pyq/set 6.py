'''1. Write a Python program to create a list which stores square of each number between a and b (both 
included) using function. Function name is SQUARE_SEQUENCE() which accepts two numbers 
and return a list.'''


# def SQUARE_SEQUENCE(a,b):
#     l=[]
#     for i in range(a,b+1):
#         l.append(i*i)
#     return l
# a,b=int(input()),int(input())
# k=SQUARE_SEQUENCE(a,b)
# print(k)


'''2. Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words 
after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Input supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again 
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world'''

# s=input()
# k=s.split()
# p=set(k)
# q=list(p)
# q.sort()
# t=' '.join(q)
# print(t)


'''3. Write a program to compute the frequency ofthe words from the input. The output should output after sorting 
the key alphanumerically.
Input supplied to the program:
NewtoPythonorchoosingbetweenPython2andPython3?ReadPython2orPython3. 
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1 
Python:5 
Read:1 
and:1 
between:1 
choosing:1 
or:2
to:1'''
